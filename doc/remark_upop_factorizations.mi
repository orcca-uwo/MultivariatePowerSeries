##SUBSECTION(collapsed=false) Remark
##- The functions "ExtendedHenselConstruction" and "PuiseuxFactorize" both factorize  a
##	univariate polynomial over the field of univariate Puiseux series into
##  linear factors, thus into irreducible factors. The "ExtendedHenselConstruction" can also factorize a univariate polynomial over multivariate Puiseux series into linear factors.
##  In contrast, the "HenselFactorize"
##  command only lifts the initial factors of the input polynomial
##  over the ring of power series __"`&Copf|;` &lobrk; y &robrk;"__, thus
##  the factors may not be linear and, hence, may not be
##  irreducible over the field of univariate Puiseux series.
